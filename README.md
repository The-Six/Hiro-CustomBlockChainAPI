Notes: We setup our Chainhooks through the Hiro Platform but encountered a challenge triggering them. Attempting to resolve this, we opted to install Chainhook locally. However, we faced difficulties during the installation process, encountering errors with Cargo and subsequently with Xcode. As an alternative, we decided to emulate Chainhook's behavior by testing the example payload through Postman. This approach proved effective and enabled us to build our API.
